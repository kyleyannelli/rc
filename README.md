# How to Use
#### Note my .zshrc has a couple MacOS specific configurations that should be considered for removal on linux.
1. Install stow with `sudo apt install stow` or `brew install stow`
2. Pick what configurations you want with `stow alacritty` for example. If you would like to restore everything `stow /` will link ALL folders.
